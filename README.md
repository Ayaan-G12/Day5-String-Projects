Day 5 — String Manipulation and Text Processing Projects

This repository contains six Python projects created on Day 5 of the 40-week software engineering and data science Road Map.
These projects focus on fundamental string processing techniques such as slicing, pattern detection, validation, cleaning, and formatting. Each project follows structured coding practices, including modular functions and clear documentation.

Concepts Covered

String indexing and slicing

String methods

Text cleaning and sanitization

Pattern detection

Input handling and validation

Simple text transformation functions

Modular code structure

Projects Included

1. String Analyzer

2. Email Validator
Validates the structure of an email address.

3. Word Reverser
Reverses each word in a sentence.

4. Palindrome Checker
Checks whether input text is a palindrome.

5. Text Sanitizer
